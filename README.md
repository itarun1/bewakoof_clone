## Problem statement:

## BEWAKOOF THE NEW AGE ONLINE SHOPPING EXPERIENCE.

A thoughtful brand, we actively attempt to minimize our environmental footprint and maximize our social impact. These efforts are integrated right into our day-to-day operations, from rainwater harvesting to paper packaging to employee benefits. To create an accessible, affordable and thoughtful experience of online shopping in India.

We used HTML and CSS for styling the website and some hover effects to the buttons on the page. JavaScript DOM and LocalStorage.

CSS: It is used to add styling to the website. We used Advance CSS for Animation, Popup Modal window for login/Sign up, Payment, and for adding Address.

JavaScript: It is used to add logical functionalities to the webpages like the onClick function, DOM, and dynamic aspects of the webpage. We used localStorage to store products and Login Details. We have added all the functionalities.
## Some Snapshots of Website:
Landing Page: On Landing Page,there was a Dropdown Function and Animation in the top heading and the carousal effect of images. We achieved all functionalities. This Website is responsive you can use this in small devices also ðŸ‘‡
